    I enjoy building data-driven solutions and models that solve all kinds of complex problems.

  <p>
    I’ve had the privilege of working as a self-employed currency trader & a web
    development intern. My main focus these days is on studying, researching, and
    developing models using novel predictive machine learning and
    reinforcement learning approaches in a quantitative investment context.
